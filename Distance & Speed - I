Xinyou has been trained to drive now. Dr. Dexter wants to get to a National Conference to present Xinyou. The venue of the conference is x kms away from his workshop. He wants to know if Xinyou will be able to make it to the conference on time if he travels at y kms/h.

Write a Java program module that checks if he will be able to make it to the conference on time.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT: 

Input consists of 4 lines.
The first line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the distance 'd'. 0 < d < 32767.
The second line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the speed 's'. 0 < s < 32767.
The third line of input is a string corresponding to the time at which the conference begins – 'ti'. 
The fourth line of input is a string corresponding to the current time, 'tj'.
'ti' and 'tj'  are strictly in the 'hh:mm' format (tj<ti).
Output consists of a single string 'Yes', 'No' or 'Invalid Input'.

Constraints:
NA
Example:
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:
100
25
16:00
10:00
Yes

solution:
import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int d=sc.nextInt();
		int s=sc.nextInt();
		String a=sc.next();
		String b=sc.next();
		String []ti=a.split(":");
		String []tj=b.split(":");
		int startmin=Integer.parseInt(ti[0])*60+Integer.parseInt(ti[1]);
		int endmin=Integer.parseInt(tj[0])*60+Integer.parseInt(tj[1]);
	 if(startmin<=endmin) System.out.print("Invalid Input");
	 else if((startmin-endmin)<180) System.out.print("No");
		else System.out.print("Yes");				
	}
}
